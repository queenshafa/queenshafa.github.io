# Ran's temporary portfolio!

Personal blog template from ![@imfunniee](https://github.com/imfunniee/fimbo)

This is a temporary portfolio cus i dont have any free time because it's so close to exam and i have a lot of school assignment. Since I'm in Boarding School and i cannot use my laptop freely like 24/7. I'll make one when i'm home, at 24 July. Or i gotta hold it until the next holiday cuz i wanna practice more, hehe!

I also want to say thanks to @imfunniee for the template and @VincentGarreau for the particles.js. :D
